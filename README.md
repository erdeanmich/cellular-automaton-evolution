# Cellular Automaton Evolution 
This repo contains the code and some related information for my "Wissenschaftliches Projekt". The goal is to develop a cellular automaton which produces dungeonlike structures for games with a PCG approach. The parameters of the automaton will be evolved by a search based genetic algorithm to reach more satisfying results. 
The project will be developed with Unity and C#. 

## Requirements for the CA 
* Easy (moddable) cell representation
* Cell states: Floor (Must), Wall(Must), Startpoint(Must), Endpoint(Must) Items (Optional)
* At least size of 50x50 
* Export of whole automaton is possible 
* Easy and moddable rule representation
